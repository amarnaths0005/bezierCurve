# bezierCurve
App to display a Bezier Curve, and modify its parameters

HTML Program to draw and manipulate a Bezier Curve and modify its parameter.

Requirements:
   1. Should enable the user to modify the x, y, z coordinates of five control points,
      in the Five Point Form of Bezier Curve.
   2. The range for the coordinates should be in [-1, 1] for the end points, and [-4,4]
      for the intermediate points.
   3. Should display the Bezier Curve as a magenta curve, and this curve should 
      change dynamically as the user modifies any of the Control Polygon coordinates.
   4. Should show the Control Polygon as a yellow line.
   5. Should display the bounding box of dimension 2 units, centred at the origin.
   6. Should enable the user to modify the camera angle, from which viewing is done.
   7. Should enable the user to modify the u value, and should display a moving red point
      on the curve as the user modifies this value.
